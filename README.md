WindowsFormsApplication
=======================

Introduction
------------

This is a simple application using the Windows Forms layer and module
system representing CRUD operations (create, read, update, delete).

Installing CRUD
--------------
Just simply open the solution from the folder.

How to use
----------

After you open the solution you are going to get an exception once you try to connect ot the database. WORRY NOT! Just press ok and continue with the project. If you don't want to get irritated from the exception just don't try to connect to the database from the server explorer. Once you get through that launch the application (f5/Start). First thing to show is the login form. There are two options: either you want to log in as a member or as an admin. If you want to log in as member, the username is "member" and the password is "member pass" else "admin", "adminpass". Admins are given the privileges of the Administration Menu (to create users with admin or member rights, password and names, or to edit ones) while the members only see the View panel where they can only exit from the application.
