When you run the program you will need username and password
for administrator use: username:admin password:admin - this user can view, add, update and delete users
for member use : username: member password:member -this user can only view inserted user
for public use  username: public password:public Note: the public has no rights so the app will return incorect username and password

	If you don't have SQL Server and SQl Managment Studio you can run the program without doing any changes!
