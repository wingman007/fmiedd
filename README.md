# CRUD- Web Application with Local Database File.

This is my project which contains the logic of a system that has login and information about its users. It shows how CRUD (Create, Retrieve, Update,Delete) works together and how it is implemented for Web.
I use Local Database File to keep my data. I put the .mdf database file in the folder App_Data, which you will find in my project,
so you don't have to make any changes or anything else to use it on your machine. You are able to load it on Visual Studio (which of course has Web),
press F5 and look at how it works. I used ASP.NET Web Forms Application (not empty), so I put templates ready for use and then correct them with .css file.
