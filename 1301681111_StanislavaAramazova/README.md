Hello,
  This is simple WebForm Application connected to an SQL Server database, capable of performing simple CRUD operations.    
To make this project work, open the solution file or the project and connect GridView1 to the data source. If there is no data source, create new one with SQL Server database (default database is located in App_Data folder in project directory). Generate INSERT, UPDATE and DELETE statements for index.aspx. Then just execute the project.
