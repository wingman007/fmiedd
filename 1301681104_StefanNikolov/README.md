StefanCRUDWebApplicationAccessWithLogin
==============================

This is my project - CRUD Web Application with Login  Asp.net C# with Access database.

This web app shows CRUD (Create, read, update and delete) with Login authentication.
Shows an error when you try to log in with wrong username/password
Two types of users (admin and regular)
Admin can use all of the CRUD funcions, but the regular user can only view the table from the data base.

Try to log in with username: stefan and password: stefan123 (for admin)
Try to log in with username: georgi and password: georgi1324 (for regular user)

Delete and Update operations made by ID.
